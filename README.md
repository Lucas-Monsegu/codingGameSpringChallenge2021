# CodingGameSpringChallenge2021

This is my participation to the 2021 [coding game spring challenge](https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021). The main algorithm is a [beam search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search).


# Results

I went to the gold ligue. Not really happy with the results. The algorithm I chose was not the best for this problem at least with my beam search settings, it could have been better if I had more time to play with the hardcoded values of my beam search.

# Techos

I chose to use c# because I wanted to go a little deep in the beam search and because I like the language.
